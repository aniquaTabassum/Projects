# Equipments used:
-> Arduino Uno
-> Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
-> Male to male wires

# Objective:
To measure distance of an object in centimeters using the ultrasonic sensor and displaying it console using python

# Code notes:
    * Arduino
	Each of the const global variables represents the ultrasonic sensor pin having same name. <pore aro likhbo>

    * Python:
	Import 'pyserial' -> for receiving data from arduino
	Import 'time' -> to use the sleep() function
	serial.Serial('COMxx', n) where xx is the com port number and n is <something related to signal.. can't remember it right now>
	It creates a serial object that receives serialized input from the arduino
	incoming.decode() -> for decoding the stream.
	decodedData.rstrip() -> for eliminating \r, \f at the end of the string.
	
	And finally, we pridecodent the string. That string is the final output.
